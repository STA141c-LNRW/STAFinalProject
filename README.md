# Data enginnering
Your task is to write an R package which enables other users to carry out bag of little bootstraps for a certain model.
- Your group should open a github organization for the R package.
- The package should be well documented.
- ship it with a simple vignette to explain the usage with some data (2-3 pages).
- you choose a statistical model, for example, you may apply BLB to logistic regression model, random forests or neural networks
- Rcpp code could be used to speed up some operations
- you should give your users options to make use of parallel processing or distributed computing.

# To-do:  

Purpose of the package
1. Improve on base R
2. Use to help analysis
3. Build on HW/lecture examples  

Function ideas (to add to /R folder)  
1."BLB to logistic regression model, random forests, or neural networks"  
2. Rcpp code (optimizing sampling using cpp)

What we're doing
1. C++ to optimize the sampling function - Luke, William  
2. Multiple linear regression - 
  a. estimatation of mean, variation, slope
3. Prediction intervals
